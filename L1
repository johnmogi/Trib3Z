To build an MVP for "Tribez," let's start by outlining the necessary lists and data structures for character generation. The lists should be modular, easy to expand, and manageable. Here's a suggested approach:

### 1. Main Lists for Character Generation

- **Tribes List:** The four main tribes.
- **Descendants List:** A list of sub-groups within each tribe.
- **Attributes List:** To generate character stats like power, mana, speed, and smartness.
- **Equipment List:** Items the character may receive.
- **Quest List:** Possible quests that the character will embark on.
- **Story List:** Background stories associated with each tribe.

### Suggested Lists for Character Generation

1. **Tribes**:

   ```python
   tribes = ["Gyptians", "Atlanteans", "Ignis", "Babylonians"]
   ```

2. **Descendants** (organized as a dictionary to match each tribe with its sub-groups):

   ```python
   descendants = {
       "Gyptians": ["Egyptian Gypsies", "Eastern Europe", "Russian", "Polish", "Croatian", "Serbian"],
       "Atlanteans": ["Vikings", "Romans", "European", "Celtic", "Britton", "Gaelic"],
       "Ignis": ["North American Native", "Amazonians", "Aztec", "Mayan", "Inca", "Mexican", "Wild West Settlers"],
       "Babylonians": ["Arabs", "Jews", "Hindu", "Chinese", "Japanese", "Mongol", "Thai", "Nordic Barbarian"]
   }
   ```

3. **Attributes** (can be random values or assigned based on tribe):

   ```python
   attributes = ["Power", "Mana", "Speed", "Smartness"]
   ```

4. **Equipment**:

   ```python
   equipment = ["Rope", "Wand", "Backpack", "Dagger", "Light Crystal", "Coinage", "Elven Chainmail"]
   ```

5. **Quest List**:

   ```python
   quests = [
       "Retrieve the lost relic from the ancient ruins",
       "Defend the village from marauding invaders",
       "Find the hidden treasure in the mystical forest",
       "Negotiate peace between warring tribes",
       "Embark on a journey to discover a new land"
   ]
   ```

6. **Story List** (optional, to provide some background for each tribe):
   ```python
   stories = {
       "Gyptians": "Descendants of the great nomads, roaming the lands in search of wisdom.",
       "Atlanteans": "A seafaring people from the ancient city of Atlantis, known for their resilience.",
       "Ignis": "Warriors of fire and passion, born from the heart of the world's oldest forests.",
       "Babylonians": "Scholars and mystics, weaving the tapestry of time with their profound knowledge."
   }
   ```

### 2. Basic Game Flow

1. **Character Selection Screen**:

   - Display the four tribes in a grid layout.
   - Once the player selects a tribe, randomly generate the character's details (descendant, attributes, equipment, story).

2. **Character Generation**:

   - Randomly select a descendant from the chosen tribe's list.
   - Generate random values for attributes like power, mana, speed, and smartness.
   - Assign a random set of equipment items.
   - Optionally, provide a story and quest.

3. **Quest Handling**:

   - Assign a quest to the character based on the selected tribe or randomly.

4. **Outcome Determination**:
   - Provide success or failure endings based on simple conditions (e.g., character stats).

### 3. Implementation Plan

Start by creating a Python script that will handle:

- The character generation process.
- Displaying the character's details.
- Assigning a quest and displaying the outcome.
