# Trib3z

Welcome to **Trib3z**, a minimalist but dynamic game where players explore a grid-based world filled with encounters, quests, and endless possibilities. Inspired by various ancient cultures and parallel universes, _Trib3z_ invites you to embark on a journey across different tribes and realms as you navigate a 3x3 board (expandable in future versions). The game's mechanics are simple yet immersive, designed to keep the experience fresh with procedurally generated characters, quests, and encounters.

## 🎮 Game Overview

In **Trib3z**, players receive a generated character from one of the ancient tribes:

- **Ignis** (Fire Tribe)
- **Atlantean** (Water Tribe)
- **Gyptian** (Earth Tribe)
- **Babilonis** (Air Tribe)

The player starts the game on a tile and progresses by revealing new tiles, triggering different encounters such as combat, NPC meetings, events, and treasures. The main goal is to complete randomly assigned quests while exploring the map and overcoming challenges.

## 🛠️ Development Goals

1. **Core Game Mechanics**: Implement tile-based movement, character generation, and basic encounters.
2. **Expansive Content**: Gradually add more character traits, events, enemies, and quests.
3. **Web-Based or Python-Based Core**: Start with a simple, web-based or Python-based framework.
4. **Offline Mode (Optional)**: Develop a tabletop version with cards, dice, and a physical board.
5. **Community Engagement**: Encourage community participation through GitHub, newsletter subscriptions, donations, and social media.

## 📚 How to Play

1. **Start a New Game**: Select a character and receive your quest.
2. **Explore the Board**: Move from tile to tile, revealing encounters.
3. **Complete the Quest**: Fulfill the quest requirements to win.
